# Home-Credit-Default-Risk
##### This is a competition from Kaggle

#### Objectives:

##### Forecasting whether or not a borrower will repay a loan or have difficulty is a critical business need. In project 1, our group wants to predict the probability of repaying a loan for each borrower. The data is provided by Home Credit, a service dedicated to providing lines of credit (loans) to the unbanked population. The dependent variable is the probability of default and independent variables are features related to the performance of repayment. Through optimization, our group would compare different models and features to secure a relatively good performance to predict the result.

#### Data description: 

##### In total, we have 224 variables and target as 1 and 0 (approved or not). First, we have information about loan and loan applicants at application time. Then, using ID linking to the bureau, we have application data from previous loans that applicants got from other institutions that were reported to Credit Bureau such as Sum of Credit Amount and Credit Days Overdue, and also behavioral data. Also, we have the data from the company's database. We have information about previous loan parameters and previous information about the clients at time of previous loans. In detail, we have past payment data for each installments of previous credits related to loans such as Amount of Installment and Amount of Payment and credit card balance data and behavioral data for each client such as Amount Receivable and Drawing from ATM.
