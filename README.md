# Home-Credit-Default-Risk
##### This is a competition from Kaggle

#### Objectives:

##### Forecasting whether or not a borrower will repay a loan or have difficulty is a critical business need. The data is provided by Home Credit, a service dedicated to providing lines of credit (loans) to the unbanked population. In project 1,  predicted the probability of repaying a loan for each borrower through supervised learning. The dependent variable is the probability of default and independent variables are features related to the performance of repayment. Through optimization, compared different models and features to secure a relatively good performance and to predict the result. In project 2, used unsupervised learning model to understand the internal structure of the data through classifying customers and analyzing the weight of variables in identifying whether customers default.

#### Data description: 

##### In total, we have 224 variables and target as 1 and 0 (approved or not). First, we have information about loan and loan applicants at application time. Then, using ID linking to the bureau, we have application data from previous loans that applicants got from other institutions that were reported to Credit Bureau such as Sum of Credit Amount and Credit Days Overdue, and also behavioral data. Also, we have the data from the company's database. We have information about previous loan parameters and previous information about the clients at time of previous loans.
